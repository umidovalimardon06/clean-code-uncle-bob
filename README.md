Session-5 notes

Working vs working right.
working - "getting software working is easy,functional correct(runs,produces output)"
working right - "getting it right is the hard part"
-architecture
-requirements
-abstractions
-performance-characteristics
-security-model
-model
-operational-behavior(maintainability,observability)
*this requires discipline and domain understanding

all magic happens when you get it right:
*codebase -> composable,predictable,easy to extend
*features feel cheap

main goal of architecture(architect):
"is to minimize the human-resources required to build 
and maintain software systems"
efforts - constant and shrinks over time. -> then the design is good.

startup-culture: "USA,west making a mess as fast as you can in hopes that 
you can produce something that will put you on the exponential growth of profit"
they thought:  "we can remain productive and be messy,We can clean up it later!"

"slow and steady wins the race"
"the secret to going fast is not to build the roadblocks that will make you slow"

*study&practice:long-term

Jason Gormans experiment: "same program 6times in 6 separate days"

a solution to executives dilemma:sitting and make them understand whe productivity paradox.
