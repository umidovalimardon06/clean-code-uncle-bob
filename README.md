## 1. We Will Not Ship Shit

Beta does not mean broken. Everyone expects good code — there is no exception for you.

## 2. We Will Always Be Ready

If you're doing agile, you must be ready to deploy at any time. Always shippable.

## 3. Stable Productivity

The longer a project runs, the slower it does **not** get. Hurrying creates mess. Mess slows you down.

## 4. Inexpensive Adaptability

- Small change → small cost
- Big change → bigger cost

Software is *change-able ware* — design for it.

## 5. Continuous Improvement

Always be making the codebase, process, and team better.

## 6. Fearless Competence

Fragile tests are a sign of someone new to test-driven development. Tests must be designed **as part of the system**, not bolted on. Maintain code coverage. If you're afraid to change the code, you've lost.

## 7. We Will Not Dump on QA

QA is the most stressed team. The right mindset: **QA should find nothing.** Don't use them as a bug filter.

## 8. We Cover Each Other

Pair programming, even just 30 minutes a day. Know what your teammates are doing well enough to cover them.

## 9. Honest Estimates

Never give a single number. Always give three:

| Scenario | Example |
|---|---|
| Best case | 1 week |
| Nominal case | 3 weeks |
| Worst case | 6 weeks |
