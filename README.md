# Session — Project Management Notes
> *Notes from Uncle Bob's session on managing software projects*

## The Cost of Mismanagement

Poor project management leads to:

- Producing the wrong product
- Being late
- Working 80-hour weeks

---

## The Fundamental Law: Good, Fast, Cheap, Done

You can only pick **three** — not four. These qualities are in tension, and the goal is to maximize as many as possible.

---

## Managing with Data

To make informed decisions, you need data. Two essential metrics:

1. **How much was done in one week** — gives managers a basis for prediction
2. **Burn down chart** — shows how much work remains, allowing managers to predict the finishing date

> *Agile is about giving data and destroying false hope.*

---

## Dates and Requirements

The first known thing about any project is the **date**.

- **Date:** Fixed
- **Requirements:** Not fixed

This is the core tension agile is designed to handle.

---

## Scaling Agile

- Agile is designed for **small teams doing small things**
- For large teams, the answer is **many agile teams working together**

---

## Getting Bad News Early

A core principle of agile:

> *Get the bad news as soon as possible.*

Iterations exist not just to ship features — their **main job is to produce data**.

> *A positive trend in the burn down chart often means someone is putting pressure on the team* — not that things are genuinely improving.

## The Planning Game

A structured conversation between technical and non-technical stakeholders:

- Runs roughly every **2 months**
- Uses a **card-based format** where the team picks cards representing investment and cost
- Bridges the gap between business expectations and technical reality
